# Academic and Research Background
Muthu Jeyanthi Prakash is a PhD student affiliated with the Universitätsklinikum Tübingen, studying the interactions within Medial Temporal Lobe regions during working memory tasks. Specifically, she will work on understanding the neural interactions during context-dependent visual processing using human electrophysiology data (single unit activity and lfp)  to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying memory processes.Her academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Biotechnology from Anna University, India. She then pursued an International Masters in Neurosciences at the University of Bordeaux, France, where she received recognition through scholarships, namely the Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine grant and the FidEx International Mobility Scholarship. She has previous experience in computational research from internships at the Bordeaux Population Health Center, Radboud University and Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. In essence, her interests lie in utilizing interdisciplinary research insights to deepen our understanding of neural processes and memory mechanisms.
