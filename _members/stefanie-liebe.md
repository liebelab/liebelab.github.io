# Academic and Research Background

Dr. Stefanie Liebe is a Clinician Scientist currently affiliated with the University Clinic Tübingen's Department for Neurology and Epileptology and the Cluster of Excellence 'Machine Learning for Science' in Tübingen, Germany. She has a multi-disciplinary background with degrees in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience. As a psychologist, she uses cognitive concepts, experimental paradigms, and procedures to investigate cognitive functions at the behavioral and neuropsychological level. As a neuroscientist, she investigates neural correlates of vision and memory and applies classical neuroscientific data analysis tools as well as advanced machine learning methods to electrophysiological brain measurements obtained from invasive neurophysiological recordings in epilepsy patients. As a clinician, she is familiar with neurological disorders and leverages artificial intelligence methods to support the diagnostic process in epilepsy. Overall, her work is highly collaborative and involves the close interaction between clinical experts from neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, as well as experimental and computational neuroscientists.

# Education and Qualifications

Dr. Liebe studied psychology at the Technical University of Dresden and earned her PhD in Neuroscience from the Max Planck International Research School for Neural and Behavioral Sciences in Tübingen. She completed her medical training at the Universities of Tübingen and Bonn, where she started her neurological residency in the Department of Epileptology and worked as a research associate in the lab of Prof. [Florian Mormann](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de/forschung-lehre/forschungsprofil/transdisziplinaere-forschungsbereiche/tra-3-life-1/mitgliederverzeichnis/florian-mormann)). In 2020, she moved to the University of Tübingen where she continued her neurological residency in the Department of Epileptology. She is currently a Clinician Scientist with the MINT-CS program and an associated scientist of the International Max Planck Research School: Intelligent Systems.

She is a Principal Investigator on several projects funded by the 
- [Else Kröner Graduierten Kolleg “Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Brain Science” (2022)](https://www.ekfs.de/en/scientific-funding/currently-funded-projects/clinbrain-artificial-intelligence-clinical-brain)
