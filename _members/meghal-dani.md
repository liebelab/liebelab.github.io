# Profile
Meghal Dani is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS), supported by the Else Kröner-Fresenius Foundation (EKFS) through the ClinBrAIn doctoral fellowship. She is affiliated with the Explainable Machine Learning Lab [EML](https://www.eml-unitue.de/) and is jointly supervised by [Prof. Dr. Zeynep Akata](https://is.mpg.de/person/zakata) and [Dr. rer. nat. Stefanie Liebe](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/mitarbeiter/profil/2335). Previously, she also worked with the MIDAS Lab under[Prof. Dr. Med. Sergios Gatidis](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/sergios-gatidis), now at Stanford University.

Prior to her Ph.D., Meghal completed her M.Tech in Computational Biology at IIIT Delhi (2017–2019), where she focused on Deep Learning, AI for Science, and earned her bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from BIT Mesra (2012–2016). She worked as a full-time researcher (2019-2021) at Tata Research and Innovation Labs in the area of Deep Learning and AI under the supervision of Senior Scientist Dr. Lovekesh Vig and [Ramya Hebbalaguppe](https://rhebbalaguppe.github.io/). She particularly contributed to innovations in Medical image analysis and 3D Computer Vision, which led to multiple publications and patents.

Her doctoral research focuses on building safe, interpretable, and robust multimodal AI systems for healthcare applications. She develops methods that integrate clinical text, EEG signals, medical imaging, and video data for improved diagnostic support.
