# Profile
Jiaxin Wang is a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, co-supervised by Stefanie Liebe and [Peter Dayan](https://www.mpg.de/12309370/biological-cybernetics-dayan). He aims to better understand human decision-making from a distributional coding perspective, combining reinforcement learning and neural network modeling together with human intracranial electrophysiological recordings. He is also interested in how humans learn, build, and use knowledge structures, and how memory interacts with these processes. Before starting his PhD, he completed his Master’s degree at Beijing Normal University, where he investigated the neural mechanisms underlying human cooperative behavior using simultaneous intracranial recordings. When not thinking about brains or models, he can be found at the cinema, on a run, or searching for his next favorite meal.
